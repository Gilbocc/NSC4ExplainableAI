DL2 is a framework that allows training neural networks with logical constraints over numerical values in the network (e.g. inputs, outputs, weights) and to query networks for inputs fulfilling a logical formula. An example query is shown [below](#example-query). For more details read [training/README.md](https://github.com/eth-sri/dl2/tree/master/training) and [querying/README.md](https://github.com/eth-sri/dl2/tree/master/querying).

This is implementation of DL2 can be used as a library compatible with PyTorch and can be used to reproduce the results of the DL2 [research paper](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/publications/fischer2019dl2).

## Example query

```
FIND i[100]
WHERE i[:] in [-1, 1],
      class(NN1(GEN(i)), 1),
      class(NN2(GEN(i)), 2),
RETURN GEN(i)
```

This example query, spans 3 networks: a generator `GEN` and two classifiers `NN1` and `NN2`. It looks for a noise input (a 100-dimensional vector where all values are between -1 and 1) to the generator such, that it creates an input that gets classifies to class 1 by `NN1` and class 2 by `NN2`. Finally the generated input is returned.

Some files omitted.

## Installation

0 - Install Anaconda

    Fix SSL: https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/8273

2 - Create the virtual environment
    
    conda create --prefix=./envs python=3.6

3 - Activete the newly created environment
    
    conda activate ./envs

4 - Install the dependencies
    
    python ./install.py

5 - To disable the virtual environment use
    
    conda deactivate

6 - To delete the envireonment use

    conda env remove -p ./envs

## Reproducing Results and Examples
For examples see the files in`training` and `querying`, which implement the experiments from the paper.
Each folder contains it's own `README.md` with further instructions on how to use the library and on how to reproduce the results.
